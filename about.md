# About Me

Hi! I’m **Ángel Formoso Caamaño**, a game developer who’s been shaping his path in programming and interactive worlds since **2019**, when I began studying Digital Creation, Animation and Video Games. It’s been a long road full of learning, challenges, and exciting discoveries — and in many ways, it still feels like the journey has just begun.

As a player, I’m drawn to games that challenge and reward mastery. Some of my all-time favorites are **Slay the Spire**, **Elden Ring**, and even the occasional match of **League of Legends**. I love roguelites and card-based games for their endless variety, and I enjoy the **soulslike genre** for its demanding gameplay, sense of achievement, and even the occasional breathtaking scenario.

Outside the editor, I recharge by **climbing** (great for problem-solving with a different kind of friction) and hanging out with my kitten **Gnar**, the unofficial QA lead at home.

One of my biggest ambitions is to create a game that inspires people the way my favorite games have inspired me: something players want to **study, master, and document**, filling wikis with knowledge, strategies, and secrets. A world that invites curiosity, rewards exploration, and grows with its community.
