**Proyecto Manthanō** was my final degree project, a solo challenge to learn **Unity** and create a complete game from scratch. The result is **Doom of Tools**, a 2D turn-based, deck-building roguelite inspired by **Slay the Spire** and **Into the Breach**.  

Almost every aspect of the game—programming, mechanics, design, art, and animation—was developed by me. Players control "tool-humans," cursed by the demon Bael, battling through the underworld on grid-based maps using strategic card-based abilities. Each run is procedurally generated, offering unique challenges and requiring constant adaptation.

## Project Goal & Methodology

The main goal was to **learn Unity independently** while producing a playable demo. My methodology included:  

1. **Game Design Document (GDD):** Defined the story, visual style, core mechanics, characters, levels, and interfaces.  
2. **Knowledge Assessment:** Identified skills required, from C# programming to pixel art, and learned them through tutorials and experimentation.  
3. **Practical Exercises:** Applied concepts in small prototypes to solve potential technical and design challenges.  
4. **Demo Development:** Built the final demo with all core mechanics, balancing gameplay and producing content iteratively.  

This approach allowed me to develop both technical and creative skills simultaneously, reinforcing my self-learning abilities and project management.

## Core Gameplay

- **Turn-Based Strategy:** Grid-based combat emphasizes positioning and card management.  
- **Deck-Building:** Characters' abilities are represented by cards, which evolve during each run.  
- **Roguelite Progression:** Randomized events, levels, and rewards ensure replayability and strategic depth.  

## Production Highlights

**Programming:**  
- Characters’ movement, attacks, health system, enemy AI.  
- Card and energy system, turn system, menus, tutorials, and sound management.  

**Art & Animation:**  
- 10 characters with idle, movement, and damage animations.  
- Pixel art backgrounds, level tiles, and menus created in **Aseprite**.  
- 60 skill cards with visual effects for attacks, feedback indicators, and UI elements.  

**Learning Process:**  
- Overcame technical challenges such as pixel-perfect rendering, managing Unity’s Animator efficiently, and separating visual objects from logic to prevent conflicts.  
- Learned to iterate on art and animations, balancing aesthetics with gameplay functionality.  
- Gained confidence in self-directed problem-solving, independent learning, and project planning.

## Reflection

Completing **Proyecto Manthanō** allowed me to:  
- Fully integrate **Unity, C#, and pixel art skills** into a complete project.  
- Understand my strengths and weaknesses in independent game development.  
- Experience the challenges of balancing ambition and scope when creating a solo project.  

The final demo showcases not only a playable game but also my ability to manage a project end-to-end, from concept and design to coding and art production.
