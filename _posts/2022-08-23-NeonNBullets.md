## Project Context

The game tells the story of **Neon Johnson**, a researcher specializing in network cases, who receives new information about his sister, **Neon Smith**, a former top agent who died under mysterious circumstances. To uncover the truth, Neon Johnson dives into the darkest sectors of the network.  

The world of Neon N Bullets imagines a society where **internet access is a basic necessity**, and VR pods allow users to fulfill nearly all daily needs without leaving their cabins. Players explore this digital underworld while advancing through the story.

### Gameplay Overview

- **Player movement:** WASD for navigation, mouse for aiming.  
- **Combat:** Shoot, dash (Space), and survive waves of enemies.  
- **Objectives:** Advance through levels while neutralizing enemies, avoiding damage, and discovering the story.

## My Contributions

I handled **all gameplay programming and player mechanics** using Unreal Blueprints:

- **Player Control:** Movement, aiming, shooting, dashing, and camera interaction.  
- **Enemy AI:** Implemented using Behavior Trees for pathfinding and attacks.  
- **Health & Regeneration:** Player life, orbs, and regeneration effects.  
- **Visibility System:** Material effect that fades objects between the camera and player.  
- **Particle Effects:** Dash particles and hit effects.  
- **Game Settings & Adjustments:** Configurations for gameplay balance and feel.  

## Development Process

The demo for the first level was developed in **four months**:

1. **Preproduction:** Concept art, sound design, GDD, level design documents, and narrative.  
2. **Production:** 3D modeling, rigging, animation, programming, music composition, UI, and voice-over.  
3. **Polishing:** Refined gameplay, visuals, and balanced mechanics.

Despite time constraints forcing the team to **cut some original GDD features**, the project lays the foundation for a full game with rich narrative and advanced mechanics.
