Everything started while I was working part-time with **Praenaris**. The studio asked me to **lead the remake of Arima Lodge**, a short narrative game originally born in a jam.  

The project, made in **Unity**, came to me in a broken state: **dialogues, animations, and much of the code** needed to be reviewed and rebuilt. My role was to **take what wasn‚Äôt working, make it functional again, and then improve it**. It was both a programming challenge and a chance to learn how to rescue an idea with potential and give it new life.

## Context  
*Arima Lodge* was originally created during the **Indie Spain Jam 2022**. Later, the studio decided to revisit it, adding quality improvements and officially releasing it on **Steam in December 2024**.  

It‚Äôs a **short 10-minute story**, set in a near-future dystopia inside a single elevator. You play as **Kai, the bellhop**, when a mysterious man forces him to ride straight to the 100th floor, things quickly spiral into tension and mystery.  

## Improvements in the Remake  
During the remake I implemented a wide range of improvements, including:  

---
- üåç **Adaptation to multiple languages**  
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Better text generation**  
- üìñ **Expanded narrative options**  
- üé≠ **Improved animations**  
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Refined timing**  
- üí¨ **Updated dialogues**  
- üîÄ **Multiple endings**  
- ‚Ä¶and many more **polish details** that elevated the whole experience.  

---

## Gameplay  
The experience is simple but effective:  
- **Limited dialogue choices** from Kai‚Äôs perspective.  
- **Quick Time Events (QTEs)** to open and close the elevator doors at the right moment.  
- A compressed **narrative structure**, where each stop and each passenger adds to the atmosphere.  

The result is short, immersive, and full of urgency. It makes you feel both trapped and curious about what‚Äôs waiting at the top.

## Style and Atmosphere  
The game uses a **low-poly visual style with a Victorian-inspired dystopia**, which works surprisingly well. The fixed camera inside the elevator amplifies the claustrophobic feeling, while the soundtrack by **Francisco Ruiz Arroyo** pushes the tension higher with each floor ‚Äî a perfect crescendo that builds pressure all the way up.  

---

## Final Thoughts  
Working on *Arima Lodge* in Unity was, for me, a mix of **technical challenge and creative rediscovery**. I had to **go through every line, rebuild what was broken, and bring coherence to the project**, but it was also rewarding to see how a jam-born game that seemed destined to fade away found a second life.  

It‚Äôs a **short, free, and very recommendable** game. You can finish it in under ten minutes, but it leaves you with the feeling of wanting more. Personally, I‚Äôd love to see this idea evolve into a bigger project ‚Äî it already feels like the perfect intro to a longer narrative experience.
