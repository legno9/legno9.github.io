Hi, I’m Ángel a **Video Game Developer** specialized in **programming**. 
{:.lead} 

I’m a  passionate about creating modular, scalable, and high-performance systems.
I work mainly with **Unreal Engine (C++/Blueprints)** and **Unity (C#)**, and I enjoy turning ideas into playable, polished experiences.
  
On this site you’ll find my **[latest projects](/projects/)**, technical solutions, and experiments in game development.  
It’s both my portfolio and a place to share what I learn along the way.  

When I’m not programming, I dive into indie games or test my patience on a Souls-like boss, all in search of design and gameplay inspiration.😉
